#Trying out ES6
===============
#####By: Tsung Hung @masterfung

##Introduction
Javascript is fun and trival. However, with ES6, things have greatly improved. I wanted to try out the features. This is my first project with ES6. 

Since ES6 is not fully integrated to all browsers, I am using Bebel to help me transpile ES6 to ES5. I have included both folders in case you want to check them out. 

##Progress
Current Progress: `Current Working`
   -Company: uses classes and inheritance
